GAME FLOW

Streams (cards 2 and 3 match)
card1 clicks   ---1----------------------
card2 clicks   ------2-------------2-----
card3 clicks   ------------3--3----------
flips          0--1--2-----3-------4-----
rounds         0--1--------2-------------
match          ------f-------------t-----
update cards   f-------f-------------t---
card1 status   d--u----d-----------------
card2 status   d-----u-d-----------u-m---
card3 status   d-----------u---------m---

Card status:
d = face down
u = face up
m = matched

Stream rules / definitions:

Flip stream:
- you can't flip the same card twice in a row if the round hasn't changed

Match stream:
- buffer card status until round end (every 2 flips)
- do the images match?

Update cards stream:
- pass match value on after a 2 second delay

Card value:
- start face down
- respond to matching flip stream once, turning face up
- after turning face up, respond to update cards stream - go face down if false, matched if true
- after turning face down, listen to matching card click stream again
- only respond do clicks when play is active (between "update cards" and "match" events)


Side effects from each card value stream:
- on a card going face up, render card's image
- on a card going face down, render card's back
- on a card going matched, remove from grid
